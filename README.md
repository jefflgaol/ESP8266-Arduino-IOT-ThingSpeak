# ESP8266-Arduino-IOT-ThingSpeak
This is a school project for ESP8266 WiFi module (Arduino-based) to read Passive Infrared sensor and send it to thingspeak.com (IOT), so the user can see the activity of the sensor. Beside that, we also implement remote switch so we can switch on and switch off the lamp using IOT too.
